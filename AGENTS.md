# AGENTS

All rules in this document are requirements — not suggestions. ALWAYS follow them.

trdl (true delivery) is an Open Source solution providing a secure channel for delivering updates from the Git repository to the end user. It uses [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to verify operations and [TUF](https://theupdateframework.io/) for secure software distribution. trdl is a multi-module Go project with three components: trdl-server (a Vault plugin), trdl-client (a CLI tool), and trdl-vault (a release CLI tool).

## Highest-priority rule (MANDATORY)

- NEVER add comments unless they document a non-obvious public API or explain genuinely non-obvious logic. NEVER add comments that restate what the code does, repeat the field/function name, describe obvious error handling, or act as section separators. When in doubt, don't comment.
- ALWAYS use `task` commands for build/test/lint/format — NEVER raw `go build`, `go test`, `go vet`, `go fmt`, or `golangci-lint` directly.
- ALWAYS verify, don't assume — check the actual state before making changes.
- ALWAYS start with the simplest possible solution. If it works, stop. Add complexity only when justified by a concrete, current requirement — NEVER for hypothetical future needs.
- NEVER leave TODOs, stubs, or partial implementations.
- ALWAYS stay within the scope of what was asked. When asked to update a plan — only update the plan, don't change code. When asked to brainstorm/discuss — only discuss, don't write code. When asked to do X — do X and nothing else. NEVER make unsolicited changes.
- NEVER modify CHANGELOG.md, release notes, or other generated/workflow-managed files unless the user explicitly requests it.
- When deleting a block from structured data files (YAML, JSON, TOML), ALWAYS read surrounding lines to verify adjacent content (anchors, references, unrelated entries) is preserved.
- When removing content, ALWAYS clean up orphaned structural elements (comment separators, section headers, blank-line groups) that no longer serve a purpose.
- When renaming a type, function, or constant, ALWAYS rename all related local variables, parameters, and error messages that reference the old name. A rename is not complete until grep for the old name returns zero hits in affected packages.

## Code style

### Design (MANDATORY)

> The code style rules below are adapted from [CODESTYLE.md](CODESTYLE.md). If you are asked to update code style rules, update CODESTYLE.md first, then regenerate this section to match, using ALWAYS/NEVER/MUST phrasing.

- ALWAYS prefer stupid and simple over abstract and extendable.
- ALWAYS prefer a bit of duplication over complex abstractions.
- ALWAYS prefer clarity over brevity in names.
- ALWAYS minimize interfaces, generics, embedding.
- ALWAYS prefer fewer types. Prefer no types over few. Prefer data types over types with behavior.
- ALWAYS prefer functions over methods. ALWAYS prefer public fields over getters/setters.
- ALWAYS keep everything private/internal as much as possible.
- ALWAYS validate early, validate a lot. ALWAYS keep APIs stupid and minimal.
- NEVER prefer global state. ALWAYS prefer simplicity over micro-optimizations.
- ALWAYS use libraries for complex things instead of reinventing the wheel.
- NEVER add comments unless they document a non-obvious public API or explain genuinely non-obvious logic. NEVER add obvious/redundant comments, NEVER add comments restating what code does. When in doubt, don't comment.

### Conventions (MANDATORY)

> The code style rules below are adapted from [CODESTYLE.md](CODESTYLE.md). If you are asked to update code style rules, update CODESTYLE.md first, then regenerate this section to match, using ALWAYS/NEVER/MUST phrasing.

- All public functions/methods MUST accept `context.Context` as the first parameter.
- All arguments of a public function are required — passing nil not allowed.
- Optional arguments via `<FunctionName>Options` as the last argument. NEVER use functional options.
- Use guard clauses and early returns to keep the happy path unindented.
- Use `samber/lo` helpers in the `server/` module: `lo.Filter`, `lo.Find`, `lo.Map`, `lo.Contains`, `lo.Ternary`, `lo.ToPtr`, `lo.Must`, etc. (not available in client/ or release/ modules).
- Constructors: `New<TypeName>[...]()`. No network/filesystem calls in constructors.
- Interfaces: ALWAYS add `var _ Animal = (*Dog)(nil)` compile-time check.
- Constants: avoid `iota`. Prefix enum constants with type name: `LogLevelDebug LogLevel = "debug"`.
- Errors: ALWAYS wrap with context: `fmt.Errorf("read config: %w", err)`. Describe what is being done, not what failed. Panic on programmer errors. Prefer one-line `if err := ...; err != nil`.

### Go standard guidelines (MANDATORY)

Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and [Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments). Commonly violated rules:

- NEVER use `this`/`self` as receiver names. Use 1-2 letter names, consistent across methods.
- NEVER discard errors with `_`. Indent error flow, not happy path.
- NEVER use dot imports.
- NEVER use named returns or naked returns.

## Commands (MANDATORY)

ALWAYS use these `task` commands. NEVER use raw `go build`, `go test`, `go fmt`, `go vet`, or `golangci-lint` directly. trdl is a multi-module project — most commands are namespaced by module.

### Building
- NEVER `go build` → ALWAYS use the appropriate build task:
  - `task server:build` — builds trdl-server Vault plugin (Linux only).
  - `task client:build` — builds trdl client CLI binary. Accepts `os=...` and `arch=...`.
  - `task release:build` — builds trdl-vault release CLI binary. Accepts `os=...` and `arch=...`.
  - `task build:dev:all` — builds all components for the current platform.
  - `task build:dist:all` — builds all components for all supported platforms.

### Testing
- NEVER `go test` → ALWAYS use the appropriate test task:
  - `task server:test:unit` — runs server unit tests (Ginkgo). Accepts `paths="./..."`.
  - `task e2e:test:e2e` — runs end-to-end tests (Ginkgo). Accepts `paths="./..."` and `focusFilter="..."` / `labelFilter="..."` to target specific tests.

### Linting and formatting
- NEVER `go vet` → ALWAYS `task lint`. golangci-lint includes vet checks.
- NEVER `go fmt`/`gofmt` → ALWAYS `task format`.
- NEVER `golangci-lint` → ALWAYS `task lint`.
- Module-specific linting: `task server:lint`, `task client:lint`, `task release:lint`, `task e2e:lint`.
- Module-specific formatting: `task server:format`, `task client:format`, `task release:format`, `task e2e:format`.

### Cleanup
- `task clean` — remove build artifacts.

## Testing (MANDATORY)

- Server tests use Ginkgo/Gomega. `testify` (`assert`, `require`) is also available in the `server/` module.
- E2E tests use Ginkgo/Gomega exclusively.
- When writing tests as an AI agent → ALWAYS name the file `*_ai_test.go`, add `//go:build ai_tests` build tag, prefix test functions with `TestAI_`.
- ALWAYS place tests alongside source files, not in a separate directory.
- Test helpers go in `helpers_test.go` (or `helpers_ai_test.go` for AI-written helpers).
- Test fixtures go in `testdata/` subdirectory next to the tests.

## PR review guidelines (MANDATORY)

- NEVER add new external dependencies without flagging to the user first.
- NEVER introduce breaking user-facing changes (not API changes) unless they are hidden behind a feature flag. Flag to the user first.
- NEVER introduce changes that may compromise security. Flag to the user first.

## Self-improvement (MANDATORY)

ALWAYS perform this step after completing any user request. NEVER skip it, even if the work "looks fine."

1. Review what went wrong during execution: wasted steps, wrong assumptions, missed dependencies.
2. If a mistake was caused by a missing rule in AGENTS.md — propose a concrete rule addition to the user.
3. If a mistake was caused by a missing rule in OPENCODE.md — propose a concrete rule addition to the user.
4. NEVER silently swallow lessons learned. ALWAYS surface them.
